## ToDo

- [x] Passing `video` or `directory` options in the configuration file using
  `~/<path>` results in an error: in the Deserialize expanding `~` to absolute
  path is required
- [x] Using `video` *date&time* overlay generated on frame grabbed makes no
  sense: disable video overlay while using `video` option
